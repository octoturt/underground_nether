# Underground Nether Generation Data Pack

This is an (unfinished) attempt at getting full nether generation working underground in Vanilla Minecraft 1.18.2, using a world generation datapack.

### Current Issues

- [ ] World generation goes to essentially the top of the world
- [ ] Entire world is generated like the nether, creating very interesting but nevertheless unintended terrain
- [ ] Only nether biome implemented is Nether Wastes
- [ ] Nether area is not exclusively nether biomes, leading to incorrect mob spawns and generation of structures and mobs.
- [ ] The ocean is missing
